# Project 3: Portfolio Optimization using Markowitz Mean-Variance and Efficient Frontier
## Overview

This project explores optimal portfolio allocation using historical stock market data from Yahoo Finance (2018â€“2023). Selected assets include AAPL (Apple), AMZN (Amazon), META, and TSLA (Tesla). By applying Markowitz Mean-Variance Optimization and the Efficient Frontier, we aim to construct portfolios that maximize returns for a given level of risk while providing practical insights for investment decisions.

## Objective

Analyze asset performance using historical stock data

Calculate portfolio risk and return metrics

Apply portfolio optimization models to determine ideal asset allocation

Visualize the trade-offs between risk and return for different portfolios

 ## Key Concepts

Portfolio optimization and risk management

Markowitz Mean-Variance theory

Efficient Frontier visualization

Expected return, volatility (standard deviation), and covariance

Sharpe ratio and risk-adjusted returns

Data preprocessing and historical performance analysis

## Features

Historical data preprocessing and modification for analysis

Trend analysis of daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly stock volumes and prices

Computation of key metrics: average return, volatility, and correlations

Construction of Minimum Variance Portfolio (MVP)

Efficient Frontier plotting to visualize optimal portfolios

Decision guidance for investment allocation

 ## Technologies Used

Language: Python

Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, pyportfolioopt
