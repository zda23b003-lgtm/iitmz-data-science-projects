# Project: Corruption Analysis Across Public Sectors
## Overview

This project explores how corruption occurs across different public sectors globally, focusing on both developing and developed countries. Using data from the V-Dem dataset, we analyzed multiple corruption indicators covering the executive, legislative, judicial, public sector, and media sectors.

## Objective

To quantify and compare corruption levels across sectors and countries.

To visualize corruption trends over time and across regions, with a focus on Africa in 2023.

To validate results using statistical methods such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA).

 Key Concepts

Corruption measurement in public institutions

## Data cleaning: converting indicators to a 0–1 scale, filling missing values

Weighted averages for multi-indicator indices

Choropleth maps for spatial analysis

Time series trend analysis

PCA for accuracy and validation

##  Methodology

Data Preparation: Converted all selected indicators to 0–1 scale, filled missing values, and created a clean dataset.

Weighted Index: Computed weighted averages for seven corruption indicators:

Executive bribery (V2exbribe_ord)

Executive embezzlement (V2exembez_ord)

Public sector corrupt exchange (V2excrptps_ord)

Public sector theft (V2exthftps_ord)

Legislature corruption (V2lgcrrpt_ord)

Judicial corruption (V2jucorrdc_ord)

Media corruption (payment for altering news coverage)

## Visualization:

Choropleth map of Africa (2023) showing corruption levels by country

Trend analysis over 20+ years for selected countries: France, United States, India, Tanzania, Zanzibar

Validation: Compared weighted averages to PCA indices to confirm high accuracy (correlation ≈ 0.995).

## Key Findings

The highest contributions to corruption come from public, legislative, and judicial sectors.

Media shows the lowest observed corruption, possibly due to underreporting.

African countries like Tanzania, Botswana, Benin, and Senegal showed the lowest corruption levels in 2023.

Trend analysis revealed increasing corruption indices in some countries over 20 years, while others like Tanzania improved significantly.

Weighted averages strongly correlate with PCA indices, confirming the reliability of the analysis.

## Conclusion

Corruption across sectors negatively impacts governance and development globally. This study highlights areas of concern and emphasizes the need for collective action to reduce corruption in both developing and developed nations.
