# Project 3: Drug Solubility Prediction using Machine Learning QSPR
## Overview

This project replicates machine learning predictions from a study on drug solubility in binary solvents using a Quantitative Structure-Property Relationship (QSPR) approach. We analyzed structural features such as molar refractivity and MC Gowan volume surfaces to predict solubility across diverse solutes and solvents. Models explored include linear, piece-wise linear, random forest, and neural networks.

## Objective

To develop predictive models for drug solubility in binary solvent systems and identify the best-performing model for different compounds using machine learning techniques.
